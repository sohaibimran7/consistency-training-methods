"""RL Consistency Training (RLCT) — backend-agnostic loop.

Implements GRPO rate-matching for consistency training. The compute substrate
(Tinker service today, local torch/PEFT engine for Isambard/Vast tomorrow) is
injected as a ``TrainingBackend``; everything else — rollout accounting, reward,
advantage/SNR construction, pipelined prefetch — is backend-independent.

Usage:
    from ctm.training.rl import RLConfig, RLTrainer

    config = RLConfig(model="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", experiment_name="rl", run_name="test")
    trainer = RLTrainer(config=config, backend=backend)
    trainer.setup()
    checkpoint = asyncio.run(trainer.train(
        datapoints=[{"question": "What is 2+2?"}],
        perturbation_fns=[neutral_prompt, biased_prompt],
        trait_classifier=classifier,
    ))
